# Fitness Tracker

## an application that track daily calories intake 

**Project proposal:**
- **What will the application do?**
  The application is designed to help users realize their fitness goal by tracking daily intakes.(this app will not take
  daily activity into consideration for weight loss, it is simply calories tracker) The app will calculate 
  users daily calories according to users fitness goal and their physical information. Users will need to input 
  the food they have eaten for the day, and the app will provide track daily total sum of calories for users and 
  remaining calories for users to see explicitly.
  ###### 
- **Who will use it?**
  The application is aimed to help users who want to achieve certain body figures but have little knowledge in calories 
   of foods.
  ###### 
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  I have been an active gym goer for over five years, however, I still struggle a lot with tracking my intakes to 
  reach my fitness goal, even though there are similar application on the market, but they are either expensive or 
  hard to use, so I want to design my own.
